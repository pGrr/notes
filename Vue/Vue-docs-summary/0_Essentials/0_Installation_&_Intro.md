# INTRODUCTION

* Vue is a progressive framework for building UIs and/or SPAs which is incrementally adoptable (thus has little size): the core is just the view, but you can plug-in a router, etc if you need them -[more](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html#What-is-Vue-js)
* Provides two-way-data-binding (reactive automatic sync between the model (js code) and the view (html DOM)) by using the virtual DOM and declarative syntax - [more](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html#Declarative-Rendering)
* Provides a way to express conditionals and loops - [more](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html#Conditionals-and-Loops)
* Provides an easy way to update the UI in response to events (e.g. user input, etc) - [more](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html#Handling-User-Input)
* Provides an easy way to realize re-usable custom html elements (components) - [more](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html#Relation-to-Custom-Elements)
* Provides an easy way to organize components into an hierarchy tree and pass data (props = property of the component which is passed as argument) from the top to the bottom of the tree - [more](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html#Composing-with-Components)
